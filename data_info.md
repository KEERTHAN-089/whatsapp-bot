# Data Storage Information
> **Applicability for Render.com:**  
> The described storage approach works for simple deployments on Render.com, as long as the application root directory is writable. However, note that Render's disk storage is ephemeralâ€”data may be lost on redeploys or restarts. For persistent storage, consider using a managed database or external storage service.
## Current Implementation

The WhatsApp Catering Bot stores data in two ways:

1. **In-memory storage** during runtime:
   - All work opportunities, worker selections, and admin states are stored in memory while the application is running.

2. **Persistent JSON file storage**:
   - Data is saved to `catering_data.json` after every request
   - Data is loaded from this file when the application starts
   - Backups can be created using the `/backup` endpoint

## File Locations

- **Main data file**: `catering_data.json` in the application root directory
- **Backup files**: `catering_data_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json` in the application root directory

## Data Structure

The JSON file contains:
- A dictionary of work opportunities (keyed by work_id)
- The current active work ID
- For backups, a timestamp of when the backup was created

## Limitations

This simple file-based storage has some limitations:
- No concurrency control for multiple writes
- Limited scalability for very large datasets
- No built-in data recovery mechanisms

## Future Enhancements

For a production environment, consider upgrading to:
- A SQLite database (simple, still file-based but more robust)
- PostgreSQL or MySQL (for larger scale deployments)
- Cloud-based database services

## Manually Backing Up Data

You can trigger a manual backup by:
1. Running your application
2. Visiting the `/backup` endpoint in a browser
3. The system will create a timestamped backup file

## Restoring from Backup

To restore from a backup:
1. Rename your backup file to `catering_data.json`
2. Restart the application
