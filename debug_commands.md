# WhatsApp Catering Bot - Debugging Guide

## Understanding Log Messages

The logs you're seeing show that your bot is running correctly:

```
127.0.0.1 - - [08/Aug/2025:07:02:19 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 33 "-" "Go-http-client/2.0"
```
This is a health check request to your root URL.

```
INFO:app:Received message: 'HELP' from whatsapp:+919353692621
```
This shows the admin sent a HELP command.

```
INFO:app:Received message: 'Ues' from whatsapp:+918050541454
```
A worker sent "Ues" (typo for "Yes").

```
INFO:app:Received message: 'CREATE' from whatsapp:+919353692621
```
The admin sent a CREATE command.

## Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Multiple CREATE commands**
   - If the admin sends CREATE multiple times in succession, it might indicate they're not receiving responses
   - Check your Twilio account dashboard to verify messages are being sent back
   - Verify the phone numbers are correctly formatted with the "whatsapp:" prefix

2. **Response not received**
   - Check if there are network delays
   - Ensure your server can send outbound requests (required for Twilio responses)

3. **Running the application**
   - Use `python app.py` or `python main.py` to start the server
   - For deployment on Render, the system will use Gunicorn to run your app

4. **Data persistence**
   - Check if `catering_data.json` is being created and updated
   - On Render, this file will be created but might not persist between deployments

## Testing Commands

Send these commands to test functionality:
- `HELP` - Should show available commands
- `CREATE` - Should start the interactive work creation process
- `LIST` - Should show all created work opportunities
- `STATUS` - Should show the status of the current work

When workers reply with "Yes", they should receive confirmation if there are open positions.
